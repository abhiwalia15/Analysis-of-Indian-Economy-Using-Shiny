# Analysis-of-Indian-Economy
This economics project mainly aims at studying and analyzing the Indian economic conditions over time, using various economic indicators from the data downloaded from World Bank.
This project is completely out of my own personal curiosity,intellect and interest in economics.

I have performed series of transformations and data tidying was performed to generate required data format which could be easily plotted. __TidyR__ and __Dplyr__ packages were mainly used to process and transform the dataset.

Economic indicators such as different kinds of GDP values, National Income, Level of employment, Per capita Income, Balance of purchases etc are present in dataset an will be used to generate time series plots in the web application(dashboard).

### Initial Release of the application-https://anishwalia20.shinyapps.io/IndianEconomyAnalysis-App/
